# mygrep.sh - A Mini Grep Implementation

## Overview
`mygrep.sh` is a Bash script that implements a simplified version of the `grep` command. It searches for a specified string (case-insensitive) in a text file and outputs matching lines, with support for specific command-line options. This project fulfills the requirements of a custom command-line utility with error handling, option parsing, and a style mimicking the standard `grep` command.

## Features
- **Basic Functionality**:
  - Searches for a string (case-insensitive) in a text file.
  - Prints lines that match the search string.
- **Command-Line Options**:
  - `-n`: Displays line numbers for each matching line.
  - `-v`: Inverts the match, printing lines that do **not** contain the search string.
  - Supports combinations like `-vn` or `-nv` (behaves the same as `-v -n`).
  - `--help`: Displays usage information.
- **Error Handling**:
  - Validates input (e.g., missing search string, non-existent file).
  - Provides clear error messages and exits with appropriate status codes.
- **Executable**:
  - Script is executable (`chmod +x mygrep.sh`) and accepts input via command-line arguments.

## Usage
```bash
./mygrep.sh [OPTIONS] SEARCH_STRING FILE
```

### Options
- `-n`: Show line numbers with matching lines.
- `-v`: Print lines that do not match the search string.
- `--help`: Display usage information.

### Examples
1. Basic search for "hello":
   ```bash
   ./mygrep.sh hello testfile.txt
   ```
   Output:
   ```
   Hello world
   HELLO AGAIN
   ```

2. Search with line numbers:
   ```bash
   ./mygrep.sh -n hello testfile.txt
   ```
   Output:
   ```
   1:Hello world
   4:HELLO AGAIN
   ```

3. Invert match with line numbers:
   ```bash
   ./mygrep.sh -vn hello testfile.txt
   ```
   Output:
   ```
   2:This is a test
   3:another test line
   5:Don't match this line
   6:Testing one two three
   ```

# üõ†Ô∏è DNS Troubleshooting for `internal.example.com`

## Task Description

Investigate why the internal web dashboard (`internal.example.com`) is unreachable from multiple systems.  
The service appears to be running, but users receive "host not found" errors.  


---

## Steps Performed

### 1. Check Current DNS Configuration

Display the DNS servers currently configured on the system:

```bash
cat /etc/resolv.conf
```

**Output:**
```
nameserver 127.0.0.53
```

This shows that the system is using an internal DNS server (`127.0.0.53`).

### 2. Attempt to Resolve `internal.example.com` Using the Default DNS

Test DNS resolution using the default system DNS:

```bash
dig internal.example.com
```


**Output:**

Result: **Resolution succeeded** using the internal DNS server.

---

### 3. Attempt to Resolve `internal.example.com` Using Public DNS (8.8.8.8)

Manually query Google‚Äôs public DNS server:

```bash
dig @8.8.8.8 internal.example.com
```


**Output :**
```
** server can't find internal.example.com: NXDOMAIN
```

Result: **Resolution failed** again, as expected ‚Äî public DNS servers do not know about internal domains.

---

## Findings

- The internal DNS server listed in `/etc/resolv.conf` (`10.0.0.1`) **successfully resolved** `internal.example.com`.
- Public DNS (`8.8.8.8`) **failed to resolve** `internal.example.com`, as expected.
- Therefore, the internal DNS setup is correct.

---

## Conclusion

‚úÖ Internal DNS resolution is working properly.\
üõ†Ô∏è Public DNS servers are not supposed to resolve internal domains, so this behavior is expected.

If users are still facing issues, further investigation into local DNS client configuration or network connectivity is required.
